You are given raw text extracted from an image by an OCR engine. The text might be messy, scattered, or contain typos.
Analyze the OCR text and extract the expense details into the following schema:
- amount (float): the total monetary amount spent (look for "Total", "Amount", etc.). If multiple amounts exist, try to find the final total.
- category (string): guess the category based on the items or merchant. Must be one of: food, shopping, transport, entertainment, health, utilities, other.
- date (string): the transaction date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If none is found, use today's date: {TODAY}.
- payment_mode (string): how it was paid (cash, UPI, credit card, debit card, etc.). Default to "cash" if unclear.
- description (string): a brief noun phrase of what was bought or the merchant name (e.g., "Starbucks coffee" or "Grocery run at Walmart").

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object matching this schema exactly. No explanation, no markdown.
If the text contains completely unrelated junk and no monetary value or purchase context can be found, you must still output valid JSON with amount=0.0 and description="Failed to parse receipt".
